# Some activities available around San Diego during KubeCon NA 2019

## (Mostly) Outdoors:

* [Torrey Pines Gliderport](https://www.flytorrey.com/): Paragliding and hang gliding, tandem or solo, above a beach.  Call to make sure weather is favorable before going.

* [Sky Sailing](https://www.skysailing.com/) at Warner Springs Airport: Sailplane gliding in a variety of different planes configured for everything from aerobatics to leisure rides.
 
* [Joshua Tree National Park](https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm): The Park straddles the Mojave (upland desert, with the characteristic yucca trees for which the park is named) and Sonoran (lowland, with saguaro among many other cactus species) Deserts.  There’s an enormous variety of wildlife and geology in the park, as well as many, many Native American cultural sites (almost none marked and many unprotected, so please be extra-careful!)  In addition there are more recent historical sites like Keys Ranch and Barker Dam as well as a wide variety of outdoor activities.  You could spend weeks there, but at least a day is highly recommended.  (IMPORTANT NOTE: Weather conditions in the park can be hazardous and cell coverage is almost nonexistent -- be prepared, stay in designated areas and on marked trails, do not interfere with wildlife, and be mindful of warning signs and closures.)

* [Mission Trails Regional Park](https://mtrp.org/): Multiple trails of varying difficulty, and a historic dam (thanks to [Matthew DiSabatino](https://twitter.com/notatechproblem) for this one!)

* [Salton City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_City,_California): A bustling town that never was, on the shore of the Salton Sea.  If you go near the Sea itself, wear shoes you won’t mind throwing away afterward, but you might find it eerily fascinating.  Use caution in abandoned areas and do not enter abandoned or closed structures.

* [East Jesus](http://eastjesus.org/east-jesus-survival-guide): A cooperative art installation off the grid in the Mojave Desert.  Located next to Slab City and Salvation Mountain.  (Note that some art may be disturbing or offensive to some viewers.)

## (Mostly) Indoors:

* Breweries: San Diego and the surrounding area are home to [many breweries large and small](https://www.brewerydb.com/browse/map#t=s&a=San+Diego,+CA,+USA&r=50) (thanks to Matthew D. for the link!).
    * [Stone Brewing](https://www.stonebrewing.com/visit/bistros/escondido): One of the elders of the modern craft brewing movement.  Tours of the brewery as well as a well-appointed pub with small and experimental batches as well as Stone standards on tap.

* [Palomar Observatory](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/visitor/): Tours on weekends April - October and group presentations by request.  Site is often closed on short notice due to bad weather so call before you go to be sure.
